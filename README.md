# C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
This files is about Sorting algorithms

#### What is a Sorting algorithm ?
A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list into an order.

Here a list of some sorting algorithms :
+    Selection Sort
+    Bubble Sort
+    Insertion Sort
+    Merge Sort
+    Quick Sort
+    TimSort
+    Gnome Sort
+    Tree Sort
+    Odd-Even Sort / Brick Sort
+    3-way Merge Sort


#### What's is Big O
Big O is a relative representation of the time complexity of an algorithm.
It's a metric used to determine the efficiency of an algorithm, allowing you to estimate how long your code will run on different sets of inputs and measure how effectively your code scales as the size of your input increases

Here some example

+ O(1) Constant complexity
+ O(n) Linear complexity
+ O(logn) Logarithmic complexity
